## About Organization Discussions

This is the source repository for our organization discussions. Please check our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Spellhold-Studios/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating.

> GitHub Discussions make it easy to communicate with your community, ask and answer questions, share updates, and more. You can use Organization Discussions as a place for your organization to have conversations that aren't specific to a single repository within your organization.

> When you enable organization discussions, you will choose a repository in the organization to be the source repository for your organization discussions. You can use an existing repository or create a repository specifically to hold your organization discussions. Discussions will appear both on the discussions page for the organization and on the discussion page for the source repository.
